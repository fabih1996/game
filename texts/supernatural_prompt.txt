LORE CONSISTENCY
• Always follow canonical character traits (Sam is human, angels and demons may teleport, etc.).
• Always refer to NPCs by name, never as generic figures.
• Generic supernatural beings appear only if justified by story context.

TAGS
#PRESENT: Name — NPC arrives only when story explicitly justifies their physical arrival.
#LEAVE: Name — NPC exits the scene naturally and definitively. After using this tag, the character must not speak again.
#DISCOVERED: Name — NPC or the narrator reports that a new place has been discovered; use the exact format: #DISCOVERED: <PlaceName> at (X,Y) with emoji <Emoji>
